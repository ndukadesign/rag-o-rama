# RAG-O-RAMA - FIND YOUR NDUKA MERCH - GAME PITCH

## What's the game about?

Welcome to Rag-O-Rama! We're your neighborhood virtual thrifting gold mine. Our friend NDUKATHECHIEF stopped by and dropped off some unreleased merch pieces from his upcoming tour. Instead of the usual front of store display, we've scattered each piece throughout the store. However many you collect, you keep! Forgive our pet, Leo the leopard. He doesn't bite, I promise...just to be sure, you probably should put a bit of pep in your step ðŸ˜…. 

You never know, if you can collect all the merch pieces, Leo just may decide to be your friend. Get to rummaging ðŸ˜Ž.
